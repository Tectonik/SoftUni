# JS Asynchronous Programming Notes

## Asynchronous methods

- setTimeout()

## Promises

- Object holding async operation
- States
    - Pending (running)
    - Fulfilled (finished, result available)
    - Failed (error available)
- new Promise()
- .then()
- .catch()
- Methods
    - .resolve()
    - .reject()
    - .all()

## Async/Await

- .catch() -> Exception
- In C#, this is implemented using threads
- In JS, this is implemented using events fired by the event loop

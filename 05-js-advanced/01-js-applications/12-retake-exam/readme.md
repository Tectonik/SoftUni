# Notes

- Used cdn for Firebase because it kept whining about using the production library
- Some routes were missing '#'. I added it, as I was told I could
- It says "NOTE: You get all the points if all the notifications have the exact content as described in each section above.", but I never found the exact text I need to use, so I used the same style and grammar as the examples
